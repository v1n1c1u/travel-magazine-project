                            <p>On the Shetland Islands, a hundred miles north of the Scottish mainland, a 550-yard-long sand causeway connects two postcard-perfect beaches: one on the main southern island, and the other on the tiny St. Ninian’s Isle. On St. Ninian’s, the ruined chapel was the site of a large excavation of Pictish silver (now in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh). The coast wends its way around deep inlets, home to birds including skerries, gannets, and puffins. Near the town of Oban in the West Highlands, Kilmartin Glen comprises around 350 archaeological sites that span 5,000 years of history. Many of these date from the Bronze and Neolithic Ages and include stone circles, cairns, and rock art. Learn more on a guided walk from Kilmartin Museum (booking essential). The museum has recently undergone extensive refurbishment and houses ancient ceramics and weapons, many of which were excavated just outside.</p>

                            <p>In the 16th century, Ghent lost it all on the wrong bet. Built around rivers and canals, it was Europe’s second-largest urban centre, falling just behind Paris. When Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who ruled over Belgium, raised taxes to fund military action abroad, the city refused to pay out. They’d already given a fair share, locals argued, and surely Charles, who had been born in Ghent, wouldn’t turn on his home. In response, he marched into the city with his army, stripping it of its finery and parading its leaders in their undershirts, nooses around their necks.</p>

                            <p>The Mile High City, so named because it stands one mile above sea level, is scaling new heights. Situated where the Great Plains meet the Rocky Mountains, Denver was founded as a gold-mining town in 1858 — a history commemorated by the gold-plated dome of the state capitol. Today, it’s known for its gleaming skyscrapers and is one of the fastest-growing cities in the US, with urbanites and travellers alike drawn to its art trails, craft beer and elevated food scene (featuring everything from cheese-filled khachapuri bread to beef tacos), plus its boundless opportunities for outdoor pursuits.</p>

                            <p>It’s easy to assume that a trip to one of America’s 63 national parks would include hiking. After all, the U.S. park system features more than 21,000 miles of trails, including many among the most spectacular in the world. But following a footpath is just one of many ways to explore “America’s best idea.” From soaring over the desert in a hot-air balloon to surveying the tiny universes inside coastal tidepools, here are eight stellar park experiences, no boots required.</p>

                            <p>Since the introduction from their native Japan in the early 1900s, blossoming cherry trees signaled seasonal change in the United States. Bred for blooms and not for fruit, varieties like Yoshino, Kwanzan, and Akebono explode in a showy spectacle of delicate pink and white flowers for around two weeks each year. The downy blooms blanket parks, gardens, and towns in a visual transition away from the harsh chill of winter and toward the growing warmth of longer days.</p>
